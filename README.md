# learn-scala3

An opinionated list of Scala 3 FP resources. There are many similar lists out there. This is just my opinion on what to start out with when learning Scala

# Books
 - [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala-second-edition)
 - [Scala with Cats](https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/)

 The books are listed in suggested reading order. There are plenty of other great books to check out as well.

# Official Documentation
 - [Scala 3 book](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/introduction.html)
    No need to read through this book, but it's great for looking up things when learning the language.

# Online courses
 - [Rock The JVM](https://rockthejvm.com/)

# Libraries
 - [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/)
   The pure asynchronous runtime for Scala
 - [fs2](https://fs2.io/#/)
    Functional, effectful, concurrent streams for Scala
 - [http4s](https://http4s.org/)
    Typeful, functional, streaming HTTP for Scala, built using fs2

# Getting Started TODO
 - [ ] Build a pure functional CLI application with [Decline Effect](https://ben.kirw.in/decline/effect.html)
 - [ ] Build a pure functional web server using http4s.
